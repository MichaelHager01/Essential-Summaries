# Essential Summaries

I am creating a website for a client that will allow a user to access the website and upload needed files in a Dropbox which will then be added to my client's Google Drive. I will be doing this using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Current State 1/17/2024

I currently have made some minor improvements to the visual appeal of the website, specifically editing the CSS file. The upload function in the Python code has also been slightly altered for efficiency. Upcoming updates I would like to work on include sending an email confirmation after uploading and creating another HTML file to be redirected to after successful upload.
