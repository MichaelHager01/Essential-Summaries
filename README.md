# Essential Summaries

I am creating a website for a client that will allow a user to access the website and upload needed files in a dropbox which will then be added to my clients Google Drive. I will be doing this using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Current State 1/12/2024

I have just established the website publically and linked the domain name so the website can now be accessed. I am currently working on simple adjustments for visual appeal on the website after a user submission. Potentially adding a seperate html page for when the submission is complete.
