# Essential Summaries

I am creating a website for a client that will allow a user to access the website and upload needed files in a dropbox which will then be added to my clients Google Drive. I will be doing this using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Current State

Currently I am able to create a link locally from my website to the Google Dive API, but not from the public website. I am working on this so the website can be functional and I can start redesigning the website for visual appeal and add more functionality.
